# HeroComponent Documentation

## Overview

The `HeroComponent` is a React component used to display a hero section on a web page. A hero section typically contains a title, a description, and a call-to-action (CTA) button. This component is designed to be used in conjunction with the `react-router-dom` library for navigation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `HeroComponent`, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- React.js: You should have a basic understanding of React and have it set up in your project.

## Installation

You can include the `HeroComponent` in your project by importing it from the appropriate source file.

```javascript
import { HeroComponent } from "./HeroComponent"; // Adjust the import path as needed
```

## Usage

### Props

The `HeroComponent` accepts the following props:

- `data` (type: `HeroComponentProps`): An object containing the following properties:
  - `title` (type: `string`): The title of the hero section.
  - `description` (type: `string`): The description or text content for the hero section.
  - `cta` (type: `object`): An object with CTA (Call-to-Action) properties:
    - `url` (type: `string`): The URL the CTA button should navigate to.
    - `label` (type: `string`): The text label displayed on the CTA button.

    - `styles` (type: `string`): Additional CSS styles for the image.
    - `imageOrder` (type: `number`): The order in which the image is displayed (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `HeroComponent`:

```javascript
import { HeroComponent } from "./HeroComponent"; // Adjust the import path as needed

const App = () => {
  const heroData = {
    title: "Welcome to Our Website",
    description: "Discover amazing content and services.",
    cta: {
      url: "/explore",
      label: "Get Started",
    },
    image: {
      type: "image",
      src: "/path-to-image.jpg",
      styles: "use any valid tailwind css styling here",
      imageOrder: 1,
    },
  };

  return (
    <HeroComponent data={heroData} />
  );
};
```

### Styling

The `HeroComponent` uses taiwlind utility classes for styling, making use of tailwindcss classes. You can customize the appearance by modifying the class names and styles within the component's JSX.

### Navigation

The CTA button included in the `HeroComponent` uses `react-router-dom` for navigation. Ensure that your project is set up to handle client-side routing if you plan to use this component.

## Important Notes

- Make sure you have installed and configured the required dependencies for `react-router-dom` if you plan to use the CTA button for navigation.
- Customize the component's appearance by adjusting the tailwindcss classes, image source, and other styles to fit your project's design.

## Conclusion

The `HeroComponent` is a versatile component for creating visually appealing hero sections on your website. By providing the necessary data through props, you can easily create and customize engaging hero sections that grab your users' attention.
